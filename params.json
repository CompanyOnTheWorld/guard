Start exploring the many Guard\r\nplugins available by browsing the [Guard organization](https://github.com/guard) on GitHub or by searching for `guard-`\r\non [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=guard-).\r\n\r\nWhen you have found a Guard plugin of your interest, add it to your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngroup :development do\r\n  gem '<guard-plugin-name>'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the init section of the Guard usage below to see how to install the supplied plugin template that you can install and\r\nto suit your needs.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGuard is run from the command line. Please open your terminal and go to your project work directory.\r\n\r\nLook here for a full [list of Guard commands](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/List-of-Guard-Commands)\r\n\r\n### Start\r\n\r\nJust launch Guard inside your Ruby or Rails project with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle exec guard\r\n```\r\n\r\nGuard will look for a `Guardfile` in your current directory. If it does not find one, it will look in your `$HOME`\r\ndirectory for a `.Guardfile`.\r\n\r\nPlease look here to see all the [command line options for Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Command-line-options-for-Guard)\r\n\r\nInteractions\r\n------------\r\nPlease read how to [interact with Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Interacting-with-Guard) on the console and which [signals](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Interacting-with-Guard#guard-signals) Guard accepts\r\n\r\n\r\nGuardfile DSL\r\n-------------\r\nFor details on extending your `Guardfile` look at [Guardfile examples](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Guardfile-examples) or look at a list of commands [Guardfile-DSL / Configuring-Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Guardfile-DSL---Configuring-Guard)\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n\r\nBefore reporting a problem, please read how to [File an issue](https://github.com/guard/guard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-an-issue).\r\n\r\nDevelopment / Contributing\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nSee the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/guard/guard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development).\r\n\r\n#### Author\r\n\r\n[Thibaud Guillaume-Gentil](https://github.com/thibaudgg) ([@thibaudgg](http://twitter.com/thibaudgg))\r\n\r\n#### Core Team\r\n\r\n* R.I.P. :broken_heart: [Michael Kessler](https://github.com/netzpirat) ([@netzpirat](http://twitter.com/netzpirat), [flinkfinger.com](http://www.flinkfinger.com)).\r\n* [Rémy Coutable](https://github.com/rymai).\r\n* [Thibaud Guillaume-Gentil](https://github.com/thibaudgg) ([@thibaudgg](http://twitter.com/thibaudgg), [thibaud.gg](http://thibaud.gg/)).\r\n\r\n#### Contributors\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/guard/guard/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/guard/guard/graphs/contributors)\r\n [Please visit:http://companyontheworld.github.io/guard.]","google":"supriyantomaftuh","note":"Don't delete this file!
